  a. Open up a terminal (Mac | Unix) or command prompt (Windows)
  b.  Paste the following and hit enter:
    python --version

3. You should see "Python 3.X.X", we just care if it starts with "Python 3"

4. If it does not say Python 3 but you are sure you downloaded Python 3 then run the following
  python3 --version

  a. Open up a terminal (Mac | Unix) or command prompt (Windows)
